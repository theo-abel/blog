## Whoami

Currently a student at [Ã‰cole 2600](https://ecole2600.com/), a school specializing in cybersecurity. I enjoy CTF challenges and participate in them from time to time on online platforms or in person. I like to learn new things and share my knowledge with others. I also enjoy writing articles about various topics, including programming, cybersecurity, and research subjects.

I am passionate about programming and have experience in various languages, including Rust, Python, C, C++, Ruby and Java. I have a strong interest in low-level programming and operating systems, which has led me to explore topics such as x86-64 architecture and hypervisors. I have a solid understanding of computer science fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

I am also interested in the whole cybersecurity ecosystem, including offensive and defensive security. I have experience with various tools and techniques used in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment and research, and incident response. I am always looking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field.

As an open-source enthusiast, I believe in the power of collaboration and community. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers to create innovative solutions to complex problems. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I am excited to share my knowledge and experiences with others through this blog.

A GNU/Linux user for ~5 years, the terminal is currently in the top 3 of my best friends. I am a big fan of the [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) distribution, which I have been using for a while now. I enjoy customizing my system and exploring the various tools and utilities available in the Arch Linux ecosystem.
